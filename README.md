# Deep_Homography
This project is keras implementtion of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf">Deep Image Homography Estimation</a> paper by DeTone, Malisiewicz and Rabinovich. In the paper the introduced two networks for training, for this project we focused on the implementation of the Regresion Network.
## The Dataset
To generate the dataset used in the paper, your must download the the <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#download">MSCOCO dataset</a>[train2014, val2014, test2014]. Then run the python data generator codes found in the data_generator folder.
## Training
